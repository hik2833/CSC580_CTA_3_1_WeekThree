# CSC580_CTA_3_1_WeekThree
# CSC580 CTA 3.1 - Linear Regression with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates using TensorFlow to train a simple linear regression model on noisy synthetic data. The assignment requires:

- Generating random linear data with noise
- Plotting the training data
- Creating TensorFlow placeholders
- Declaring trainable variables (weight and bias)
- Defining the hypothesis, cost function, and optimizer
- Running the training process
- Printing final cost, weight, and bias
- Plotting the fitted regression line on top of the original data
